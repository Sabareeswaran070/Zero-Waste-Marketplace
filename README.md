# Zero-Waste Marketplace - Starter Project

This is a minimal starter Next.js (App Router) project for the Zero-Waste Marketplace hackathon idea.
It includes a small frontend, simple API route handlers, and Mongoose models to get you started.

## Quick start

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill values.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`

Note: API routes use Next.js route handlers and require Node.js environment. The provided code is minimal and intended as a starting point â€” extend auth, validation, and production readiness as needed.
